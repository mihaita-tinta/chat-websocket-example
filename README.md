Websocket example
This is a websocket chat. It is a very simple example to show how to communicate using Websocket.

=> chat-server contains a global chat to broadcast messages to all users
=> secured-chat-server contains basic authentication and the users can send private messages
  Try username: mihaita / password: a and username: cosmin / password: b in two incognito windows and send messages to one or to the other

The unauthenticated version can be found here:
